/* (iii) The local government wants to maintain a history of all drivers’ license expiry dates. Write a trigger to record the current and new lic_expiry date of a driver’s license whenever there is a change in a driver’s license expiry date. The trigger must check if the new licence expiry date is at least 30 months (2.5 years) later than current license expiry date, otherwise it must prevent the change.
Hint: to carry out this task, you need to create another table where the history of all drivers’ license expiry dates is recorded. In the table, include the licence number, the current expiry date, the new expiry date and the date when the update is done.
